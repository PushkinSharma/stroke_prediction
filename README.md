# Stroke Prediction and EDA
## Exploring data preprocessing, creating and deploying basic machine learning models.

- EDA using Plotly on a raw healthcare dataset (containing info about stroke events) to obtain useful insights. 
- Comparing accuracies of 3 different supervised machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest Classifier on the dataset and soon to be  hosted on Streamlit.
